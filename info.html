        <p>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. <br>
		You are X , your friend (or the computer in this case) is O . <br>
		Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.<br>
		The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.<br>
		When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. <br>
		If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</p>
